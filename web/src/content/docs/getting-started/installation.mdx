DogLog can be added to projects by installing it as a vendor dependency (vendordep).
You can read more about vendordeps on [the WPILib docs](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/3rd-party-libraries.html#installing-libraries).

DogLog can be added using the WPILib VS Code extension, or by manually entering the vendordep URL.
