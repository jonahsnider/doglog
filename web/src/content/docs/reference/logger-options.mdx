By default, DogLog uses default settings that will be safe for a competition environment, but most users will want to tweak the settings to suit their team's needs.

## NetworkTables publishing

The `ntPublish` option controls whether logs should be published to NetworkTables.

This introduces some overhead, and can consume a lot of network bandwidth, so this option should not be used with competition flashed radios.

```java
DogLog.setOptions(new DogLogOptions().withNtPublish(true));
```

## Capture NetworkTables

The `captureNt` option controls whether all NetworkTables values should be included in logs.

This greatly increases the size of logs, and can introduce more overhead when logging.

```java
DogLog.setOptions(new DogLogOptions().withCaptureNt(true));
```

## Capture driver station

The `captureDs` option controls whether joystick data and driver station values (ex. "enabled" or "autonomous") should be included in logs.

Due to a a limitation in WPILib's `DataLogManager`, these values can't be published over NetworkTables.

```java
DogLog.setOptions(new DogLogOptions().withCaptureDs(false));
```

## Log extras

The `logExtras` option controls whether "extra" data like PDH currents, CAN bus usage, battery voltage, and other system stats should be included in logs.

```java
DogLog.setOptions(new DogLogOptions().withLogExtras(false));
```

## Disabling the logger

By default, the logger is enabled.
When disabled, all log calls will be ignored and nothing will be logged, which can be useful when debugging things like performance issues.

If you want to disable it, you can do so with `DogLog.setEnabled()`:

```java
DogLog.setEnabled(false);
```

And you can re-enable it with:

```java
DogLog.setEnabled(true);
```
